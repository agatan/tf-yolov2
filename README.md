# YOLOv2 in tensorflow

This is a tensorflow implementation of YOLOv2. This implementation is mainly based on [allanzelener/YAD2K: YAD2K: Yet Another Darknet 2 Keras](https://github.com/allanzelener/YAD2K) and [thtrieu/darkflow: Translate darknet to tensorflow. Load trained weights, retrain/fine-tune using tensorflow, export constant graph def to mobile devices](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow).
The original paper of YOLOv2 is [YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242).

**NOTE**: This is an experimental project and for studing. The performance is not evaluated yet.
